## Public Documentation Mirrors

Divergent Trading Systems maintains public repositories for the sole purpose of
transparency and regulatory signaling.

### Characteristics
- Read-only
- No operational authority
- No production impact
- No execution capability

### Source of Truth
All authoritative implementation resides in a **private internal monorepo**.
Public repositories are mirrors and may lag internal state.

### Compliance Alignment
This structure supports:
- Information segregation
- Least-privilege disclosure
- Audit traceability
- Regulatory clarity

Public mirrors are **not** relied upon for operational decisions.
