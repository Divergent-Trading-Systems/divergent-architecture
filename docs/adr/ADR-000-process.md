# ADR-000: Architecture Decision Record Process

## Status
Accepted

## Context
This repository serves as a **public-facing, read-only mirror** of
architecture and governance documentation.

Decisions affecting public understanding must be:
- Auditable
- Stable
- Intentionally scoped

## Decision
We adopt a lightweight ADR process:
- Markdown-based
- Sequentially numbered
- Focused on *why*, not *how*

## Consequences
- Improves external transparency
- Prevents accidental disclosure of proprietary design
- Establishes historical accountability
